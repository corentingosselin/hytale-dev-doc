## VPS Setup Steps

### 1. Choose a Provider
Select from the list above based on your location and budget.

### 2. Select Server Specs
Refer to the specifications above. Start small and scale up as needed.

### 3. Operating System
**Recommended**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS

### 4. Initial Server Setup
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Java
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y

# Create Hytale user
sudo useradd -m -d /opt/hytale -s /bin/bash hytale

# Configure firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp  # SSH
sudo ufw allow 5520/tcp  # Hytale
sudo ufw enable
```

### 5. Install Server
```bash
# Switch to hytale user
sudo su - hytale

# Download server JAR
wget <server-jar-url>

# Create start script
nano start.sh
```

Example start script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -Xms2G -Xmx8G -jar hytale-server.jar
```

### 6. Setup Systemd Service (Optional)
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/hytale.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Hytale Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=hytale
WorkingDirectory=/opt/hytale
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xms2G -Xmx8G -jar hytale-server.jar
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable hytale
sudo systemctl start hytale
```

## Docker Setup

The community expects Docker support immediately:

```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile (community expected)
FROM openjdk:21-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY hytale-server.jar .

EXPOSE 5520

CMD ["java", "-Xms2G", "-Xmx8G", "-jar", "hytale-server.jar"]
```

## Pterodactyl Panel

From Discord:
> "Pterodactyl egg expected within hours of release" - Community consensus

Pterodactyl is a popular game server management panel. The community will likely create eggs (configurations) for Hytale very quickly.

## Performance Considerations
