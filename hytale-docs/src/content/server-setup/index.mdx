# Server Setup & Administration

Learn how to set up, configure, and manage a Hytale server.

## Overview

Hytale servers run on Java and can be hosted on various platforms. The server JAR is available at launch, with source code to be released 1-2 months after Early Access.

## Server Requirements

Based on community testing and hosting provider information:

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for world data
- **Network**: Stable connection with port 5520 open

### Performance Notes from Community

Real-world testing revealed:
- ~12GB RAM for 70 players (community report)
- 4 players exploring in different directions can strain 8GB servers
- Nitrado achieved 1.8GB idle with aggressive garbage collection
- Performance heavily depends on world generation and player activity

## Server Architecture

Key technical details from Discord discussions:

- **Multi-threading**: Each world runs on its own thread
- **Tick Rate**: 30 TPS (vs Minecraft's 20 TPS)
- **Modular Design**: 70+ modules that can be disabled for performance
- **Config Location**: `config.json` in world folders

## Quick Start

1. Download the Hytale server JAR
2. Run: `java -jar hytale-server.jar`
3. Configure `config.json`
4. Open port 5520
5. Start accepting connections

## Server Configuration (config.json)

Based on the decompiled `HytaleServerConfig.java`, here are the key configuration options:

### Basic Settings

```json
{
  "serverName": "My Hytale Server",
  "motd": "Welcome to the server!",
  "password": "",
  "maxPlayers": 100,
  "maxViewRadius": 32
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `serverName` | "Hytale Server" | Display name in server list |
| `motd` | "" | Message of the day |
| `password` | "" | Server password (empty = no password) |
| `maxPlayers` | 100 | Maximum concurrent players |
| `maxViewRadius` | 32 | Chunk render distance (lower = less RAM) |

### Connection Timeouts

```json
{
  "connectionTimeouts": {
    "initial": "PT10S",
    "auth": "PT30S",
    "play": "PT1M"
  }
}
```

| Timeout | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `initial` | 10 seconds | Initial connection timeout |
| `auth` | 30 seconds | Authentication timeout |
| `play` | 1 minute | Play session timeout |

### Rate Limiting

```json
{
  "rateLimitConfig": {
    "packetsPerSecond": 2000,
    "burstCapacity": 500
  }
}
```

### Module Configuration

Disable unused modules for better performance:

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "weather": { "enabled": false },
    "portals": { "enabled": false },
    "parkour": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

### Mod/Plugin Configuration

Enable or configure specific mods:

```json
{
  "modConfig": {
    "com.example:MyPlugin": {
      "enabled": true,
      "requiredVersion": ">=1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Commands

After starting your server, configure authentication:

```bash
# Use browser-based authentication
/auth login browser

# Persist credentials (encrypted storage)
/auth persistence encrypted

# For development only (not secure)
/auth insecure
```

## No Proxy Required

Hytale introduces **transfer packets** - a revolutionary feature that eliminates the need for proxy servers like BungeeCord or Velocity:

> "We have a transfer packet with a 4KB payload which will allow you to add data when switching over to another server. There will be no need for BungeeCord-like proxies." - Slikey (Tech Director)

This means:
- **Simpler infrastructure** - No proxy servers to maintain
- **Lower costs** - Fewer servers needed
- **Direct connections** - Less latency
- **Built-in state transfer** - 4KB payload per transfer

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Full support
- **Linux**: Supported (Flatpak available)
- **macOS**: Delayed due to Apple code signing requirements
- **FreeBSD**: Community discussion, unofficial support

## Server Types

### Dedicated Server
Run the server JAR on a dedicated machine or VPS for best performance.

### Home Hosting
Host on your personal computer - requires port forwarding and good internet connection.

### Managed Hosting
Use a hosting provider that manages the infrastructure for you.

## Community Wisdom

> "Pre-generate your worlds before opening to players - exploration is the biggest RAM consumer." - Performance testing insights

> "Each world is on its own thread, so multi-world servers benefit from multi-core CPUs." - Architecture discussion

> "Don't rely on UPnP - manually configure port forwarding for reliability." - Networking advice
