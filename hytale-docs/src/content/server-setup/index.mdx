# Server Setup & Administration

Learn how to set up, configure, and manage a Hytale server.

## Overview

Hytale servers run on Java and can be hosted on various platforms. The server JAR is available at launch, with source code to be released 1-2 months after Early Access.

## Server Requirements

Based on community testing and hosting provider information:

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for world data
- **Network**: Stable connection with port 5520 open

### Performance Notes from Community

Real-world testing revealed:
- ~12GB RAM for 70 players (community report)
- 4 players exploring in different directions can strain 8GB servers
- Nitrado achieved 1.8GB idle with aggressive garbage collection
- Performance heavily depends on world generation and player activity

## Server Architecture

Key technical details from Discord discussions:

- **Multi-threading**: Each world runs on its own thread
- **Tick Rate**: 30 TPS (vs Minecraft's 20 TPS)
- **Modular Design**: 70+ modules that can be disabled for performance
- **Config Location**: `config.json` in world folders

## Quick Start

1. Download the Hytale server JAR
2. Run: `java -jar hytale-server.jar`
3. Configure `config.json`
4. Open port 5520
5. Start accepting connections

## No Proxy Required

Hytale introduces **transfer packets** - a revolutionary feature that eliminates the need for proxy servers like BungeeCord or Velocity:

> "We have a transfer packet with a 4KB payload which will allow you to add data when switching over to another server. There will be no need for BungeeCord-like proxies." - Slikey (Tech Director)

This means:
- **Simpler infrastructure** - No proxy servers to maintain
- **Lower costs** - Fewer servers needed
- **Direct connections** - Less latency
- **Built-in state transfer** - 4KB payload per transfer

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Full support
- **Linux**: Supported (Flatpak available)
- **macOS**: Delayed due to Apple code signing requirements
- **FreeBSD**: Community discussion, unofficial support

## Server Types

### Dedicated Server
Run the server JAR on a dedicated machine or VPS for best performance.

### Home Hosting
Host on your personal computer - requires port forwarding and good internet connection.

### Managed Hosting
Use a hosting provider that manages the infrastructure for you.

## Community Wisdom

> "Pre-generate your worlds before opening to players - exploration is the biggest RAM consumer." - Performance testing insights

> "Each world is on its own thread, so multi-world servers benefit from multi-core CPUs." - Architecture discussion

> "Don't rely on UPnP - manually configure port forwarding for reliability." - Networking advice
