# Server Folder Structure

This page outlines a typical Hytale server directory layout. Exact names can vary by build and hosting provider, so treat this as a reference and adapt to your setup.

## Example layout

```
hytale-server/
├── Assets.zip           # Compressed content bundle
├── run.sh               # Startup script (platform-specific)
├── Server/              # Core server runtime and configs
│   ├── auth.enc         # Auth data (do not edit)
│   ├── bans.json        # Ban list
│   ├── config.json      # Main server settings
│   ├── config.json.bak  # Backup of main config
│   ├── HytaleServer.jar # Server executable
│   ├── imports/         # Imported resources/content
│   ├── logs/            # Server logs and crash reports
│   ├── mods/            # Server-side modules (mods/plugins)
│   ├── permissions.json # Permissions and roles
│   ├── universe/        # World data (one or more worlds)
│   └── whitelist.json   # Whitelist entries
```

## Notes

- `mods/` is where server-side modules live. Each module typically has its own subfolder for configs and data.
- `config.json` is the primary server config; keep a backup before major changes.
- `universe/` often includes multiple worlds or dimensions; back this up before major changes.
- `logs/` helps with debugging; keep recent logs when reporting issues.
- `Assets.zip` contains content bundles used by the server.
