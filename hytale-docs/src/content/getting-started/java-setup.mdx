# Java Installation & Setup

Hytale runs on Java, so you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to develop plugins.

## Which Java Version?

Based on community discussions and hosting provider recommendations:

- **Recommended**: Eclipse Temurin 25
  - Mentioned by Nitrado as their recommended version
  - Free and open-source
  - Regular security updates

- **Minimum**: Java 17 or higher
  - Hytale requires a modern Java version
  - Older versions are not supported

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download Eclipse Temurin from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net)
2. Run the installer
3. Verify installation:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

### macOS

Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install temurin
```

Or download from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net)

### Linux

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk
```

#### Using SDKMAN (Recommended for managing multiple versions)
```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install java 21-tem
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify Java is correctly installed:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see output like:
```
openjdk version "21.0.1" 2023-10-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.1+12 (build 21.0.1+12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.1+12 (build 21.0.1+12, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Set JAVA_HOME (Optional but recommended)

### Windows
1. Open System Properties > Environment Variables
2. Add new system variable:
   - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
   - Variable value: Path to your JDK (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`)
3. Add to PATH: `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`

### macOS/Linux
Add to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## IDE Setup

### IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)

Most popular choice in the Hytale community.

1. Download from [jetbrains.com/idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
   - Community Edition is free and sufficient
2. Install and launch
3. Configure JDK:
   - File > Project Structure > SDKs
   - Add your installed JDK

### VS Code

Alternative option with Java extensions.

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Install extensions:
   - Extension Pack for Java
   - Gradle for Java (if using Gradle)
   - Maven for Java (if using Maven)

## Next Steps

Now that Java is installed, you can:
- [Download the Hytale Server](/getting-started/server-download)
- [Create Your First Plugin](/getting-started/first-plugin)

## Troubleshooting

### "java: command not found"
- Ensure Java is in your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal
- Verify JAVA_HOME is set correctly

### Multiple Java Versions
Use a version manager:
- **SDKMAN** (Linux/macOS): Easily switch between versions
- **jenv** (macOS): Java version management
- Manually set JAVA_HOME to point to the desired version

## Community Tips

> "Make sure you're using a 64-bit JDK for server hosting - 32-bit won't have enough memory addressing for larger servers." - From Discord

> "Eclipse Temurin is the go-to recommendation - it's what hosting providers use." - Community consensus
