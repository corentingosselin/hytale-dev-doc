# Getting Started with Hytale Development

Welcome to Hytale plugin development! This guide will help you set up your development environment and create your first plugin.

## What You'll Need

### Required
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Hytale runs on Java
  - Recommended: Eclipse Temurin 25 (mentioned by Nitrado)
  - Minimum: Java 17 or higher
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (most popular) or VS Code with Java extensions
- **Hytale Server JAR**: Available at launch

### Recommended
- **Build Tool**: Gradle or Maven for dependency management
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking your changes
- **Basic Java Knowledge**: Understanding of OOP concepts

## Learning Path

If you're new to Java or plugin development, follow this recommended path:

1. **Learn Java Basics**
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Classes, methods, and data types
   - Collections and data structures

2. **Practice with Minecraft Plugins** (Optional but helpful)
   - Spigot/Paper plugins use similar concepts
   - Great way to understand event-driven programming
   - Many Hytale developers come from the Minecraft community

3. **Study Hytale Examples**
   - Check out community repositories
   - Decompile the server JAR for reference (community has done this)
   - Review existing plugins

4. **Start Building**
   - Begin with simple plugins
   - Join the community Discord
   - Ask questions and share your work

## Quick Start

```java
// Example: Basic plugin structure (Hytale-style lifecycle)
public class MyFirstPlugin {
    public void setup() {
        // Register components, events, commands
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("My plugin is running!");
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        // Cleanup
    }
}
```

## Community Wisdom

> "Don't rely solely on AI coding tools. Learn the fundamentals first, then use AI to speed up your workflow." - Community consensus

> "If you know Java, you can use Kotlin! It compiles to JVM bytecode and is fully compatible." - From Discord discussions
