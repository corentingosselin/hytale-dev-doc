# Programming Languages

Comprehensive guide to programming languages for Hytale development based on community discussions and official information.

## Overview

Hytale's technology stack includes multiple languages for different purposes:
- **Server**: Java
- **Client**: C# (Unity engine)
- **Scripting**: JavaScript/TypeScript (mentioned in 2018 trailer)

## Java (Server-Side)

### Official Status
- **Primary Language**: Java for server-side plugins
- **Official Support**: Yes
- **Minimum Version**: Java 17+
- **Recommended**: Eclipse Temurin 25

### Why Java?

From Discord discussions:
> "Java chosen for accessibility and Minecraft community familiarity" - Community insight

Benefits:
- Large existing developer community (Minecraft)
- Extensive libraries and frameworks
- Strong tooling (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Getting Started with Java

```java
// Basic plugin structure
public class MyPlugin {
    public void onEnable() {
        System.out.println("Plugin enabled!");
    }

    public void onDisable() {
        System.out.println("Plugin disabled!");
    }
}
```

- [Java for Minecraft modders](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMgDVIa0Pg8UsE-FgLW9ctkiCDe9JOAjq)

## Kotlin (Community Supported)

### Status
- **Official Support**: Not officially announced
- **Community Consensus**: Will work from day one
- **Compatibility**: Full (compiles to JVM bytecode)

### Why Kotlin?

From Discord:
> "Kotlin is fully compatible since it compiles to JVM bytecode" - Technical discussion

> "Kotlin overtook a lot of the modding community in Minecraft" - Community observation

Benefits:
- Modern language features
- Null safety
- Concise syntax
- 100% Java interop
- Growing in modding community

### Kotlin Example

```kotlin
class MyPlugin {
    fun onEnable() {
        println("Plugin enabled!")
    }

    fun onDisable() {
        println("Plugin disabled!")
    }
}

// More concise than Java
data class PlayerData(
    val uuid: UUID,
    val kills: Int = 0,
    val deaths: Int = 0
) {
    val kdr: Double
        get() = if (deaths == 0) kills.toDouble() else kills.toDouble() / deaths
}
```

### Important Note

You may need to shade the Kotlin standard library:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.22"
    id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "8.1.1"
}

tasks.shadowJar {
    relocate("kotlin", "com.myplugin.shaded.kotlin")
}
```

### Kotlin Resources
- [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-idioms.html)

## C# (Client-Side)

### Status
- **Usage**: Client-side (Unity engine)
- **Plugin Support**: No official C# plugin API announced
- **Modding**: Assets and data-driven content only initially

### Why Not C# for Plugins?

From Discord:
> "C# is used for the client-side, but server plugins are Java-based" - Community clarification

> "No official C# plugin support announced" - Current status

The client downloads assets from the server but doesn't execute code initially.

### Future Possibility

Client-side scripting may be added later:
- Graph-based visual scripting mentioned
- Not planned for launch
- Would be for client modifications, not server logic

## JavaScript/TypeScript (Scripting)

### Status
- **Evidence**: Shown in original 2018 trailer
- **Official Documentation**: Not yet released
- **Purpose**: Likely for scripting and custom content

### Community Discussion

From Discord:
> "JS for scripting was displayed in the original trailer" - Historical reference

> "JS support sounds sick especially for mini add-ons" - Community enthusiasm

### Expected Use Cases
- Custom mini-games
- Interactive content
- Simpler modifications
- Data-driven behavior

### If/When JavaScript is Supported

```javascript
// Hypothetical example
function onPlayerJoin(player) {
    player.sendMessage("Welcome!");
}

// Event registration
events.on('player_join', onPlayerJoin);
```

## Other JVM Languages

### Scala

**Compatibility**: Should work (compiles to JVM bytecode)

**Community Interest**: Minimal

**Challenges**:
- Smaller community
- Steeper learning curve
- Need to shade standard library

### Groovy

**Compatibility**: Should work (compiles to JVM bytecode)

**Community Interest**: Limited

**Use Case**: Dynamic scripting, DSL creation

### Clojure

**Compatibility**: Should work (compiles to JVM bytecode)

**Community Interest**: Very limited

**Use Case**: Functional programming approach

## Language Comparison

| Language | Official Support | Compatibility | Community Size | Learning Curve |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Java | ✅ Yes | Native | Large | Medium |
| Kotlin | ⚠️ Not official | Full | Growing | Medium |
| C# | ❌ Client only | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| JavaScript | ⚠️ Possible | Unknown | TBD | Easy |
| Scala | ⚠️ Theoretical | Full | Tiny | Hard |
| Groovy | ⚠️ Theoretical | Full | Tiny | Medium |

## Choosing a Language

### For Beginners
**Recommendation**: Start with Java

Reasons:
- Official support guaranteed
- Largest community
- Most tutorials and examples
- Easier to get help

### For Experienced Developers
**Recommendation**: Java or Kotlin

**Choose Java if**:
- You want guaranteed compatibility
- You prefer established patterns
- You want maximum community support

**Choose Kotlin if**:
- You want modern language features
- You're comfortable with build configuration
- You don't mind shading dependencies
- You value concise code

### For Minecraft Modders
**Recommendation**: Your current language

If you know:
- Forge/Fabric (Java) → Use Java
- Paper/Spigot (Java) → Use Java
- Fabric + Kotlin → Use Kotlin

Transfer your existing knowledge!

## Language Features Comparison

### Null Safety

**Java**:
```java
String name = player.getName();
if (name != null) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

**Kotlin**:
```kotlin
val name = player.getName()
println(name) // Compiler enforces null check if needed
```

### Data Classes

**Java**:
```java
public class PlayerData {
    private final UUID uuid;
    private final int kills;
    private final int deaths;

    // Constructor, getters, equals, hashCode, toString...
    // 50+ lines of boilerplate
}
```

**Kotlin**:
```kotlin
data class PlayerData(
    val uuid: UUID,
    val kills: Int,
    val deaths: Int
)
// That's it! Auto-generates everything
```

### Lambdas

**Java**:
```java
players.stream()
    .filter(p -> p.getKills() > 10)
    .forEach(p -> p.sendMessage("High kills!"));
```

**Kotlin**:
```kotlin
players
    .filter { it.kills > 10 }
    .forEach { it.sendMessage("High kills!") }
```

## Build Tool Support

### Gradle

**Java**:
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly files('libs/hytale-server.jar')
}
```

**Kotlin**:
```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.22"
    id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "8.1.1"
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly(files("libs/hytale-server.jar"))
    implementation(kotlin("stdlib"))
}
```

### Maven

Both languages work well with Maven, but Kotlin requires additional configuration.

## Community Wisdom

> "If it supports Java, expect Kotlin/Scala support to pop up from the community" - Language discussion

> "Kotlin overtook a lot of the modding community in Minecraft at least" - Community trend

> "Don't use C# for server plugins - it won't work" - Common misconception

> "Learn Java first, then switch to Kotlin if you want" - Learning advice

> "JavaScript support would be amazing for quick scripts and mini-games" - Future hopes

## Migration Guides

### From Minecraft (Java)
Your knowledge directly transfers! Hytale's plugin system is similar to Spigot/Paper.

**Key Differences**:
- ECS architecture instead of pure OOP
- 30 TPS instead of 20 TPS
- Different event names
- Modern Java features encouraged

### From Minecraft (Kotlin)
Almost identical workflow:
1. Use Kotlin plugin for Gradle
2. Shade Kotlin stdlib
3. Write plugins as usual

### From C# (Unity/Godot)
**Server Development**: Learn Java (similar to C#)

**Key Similarities**:
- OOP concepts same
- Syntax very similar
- Many patterns translate directly

## Future Language Support

### Speculative

The community expects:
- **Kotlin**: Day-one community support
- **JavaScript**: Official support eventually
- **Visual Scripting**: For non-programmers
- **Other JVM languages**: Community-driven

### Not Expected

- C# for server plugins
- Python (doesn't run on JVM)
- Lua (not mentioned anywhere)
- C++ (wrong platform)
